# My Python Learning Journey

Hey there! Welcome to my Python learning journey. I'm diving into Python with the help of the official Python Tutorial by the Python Software Foundation. Follow along as I explore the basics and work my way up!

## What I'm Doing

1. **Getting Started**: I've started reading the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).
2. **Setting Up**: I've got Python installed and ready to go on my computer.
3. **Learning Step-by-Step**: I'm going through each chapter of the tutorial one by one.
4. **Taking Notes**: I'm jotting down important stuff as I go along, so I can remember it later.
5. **Practicing**: I'm trying out the example code and doing the exercises to test myself.
