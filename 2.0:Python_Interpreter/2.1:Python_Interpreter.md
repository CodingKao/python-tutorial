# Python Cheat Sheet

## 2.1. Invoking the Interpreter

- **Interpreter Location**:
  - On Unix: `/usr/local/bin/python3.12`
  - Add `/usr/local/bin` to the Unix shell's search path to run Python by typing `python3.12` in the shell.
  - Other installation locations are possible; consult local Python resources or system administrator.
  - On Windows with Python from Microsoft Store: `python3.12` or `py.exe` if `py.exe` launcher is installed.

- **Exiting Interpreter**:
  - Use end-of-file character (Ctrl-D on Unix, Ctrl-Z on Windows) or type `quit()` to exit.

- **Line Editing Features**:
  - Interactive editing, history substitution, and code completion are supported on systems with GNU Readline library.
  - Test command line editing by typing Ctrl-P at the first Python prompt.

- **Interpreter Operation**:
  - Interactive mode when connected to a tty device, executing commands interactively.
  - Script execution with file name argument or standard input.

- **Alternative Interpreter Startup**:
  - `python -c command [arg] ...`: Execute statement(s) in command.
  - `python -m module [arg] ...`: Execute source file for module.
  - Use `-i` before script for running script and entering interactive mode afterward.

## 2.1.1. Argument Passing

- **Script and Arguments**:
  - Script name and arguments converted to a list of strings and assigned to `sys.argv` in `sys` module.
  - Access list by importing `sys`.
  - `sys.argv[0]` is the script name; `-` for standard input, `-c` for command, full module name for `-m`.
  - Options after `-c` or `-m` are left in `sys.argv` for the command or module to handle.

## 2.1.2. Interactive Mode

- **Interactive Mode**:
  - Read commands from tty.
  - Primary prompt: `>>>`, secondary prompt: `...`.
  - Interpreter version and copyright notice displayed before first prompt.
  - Continuation lines used for multi-line constructs.

## 2.2. The Interpreter and Its Environment

### 2.2.1. Source Code Encoding

- **Default Encoding**:
  - Python source files treated as UTF-8 encoded by default.
  - Most languages supported simultaneously in string literals, identifiers, and comments.
  - Use ASCII characters for identifiers in portable code.
  - Editor must recognize file as UTF-8 and use supporting font.

- **Specifying Encoding**:
  - Add special comment line as the first line of the file: `# -*- coding: encoding -*-`.
  - Encoding is one of the valid codecs supported by Python.
  - For example, `# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-` for Windows-1252 encoding.
  - Exception: If source code starts with UNIX shebang line, add encoding declaration as the second line.
