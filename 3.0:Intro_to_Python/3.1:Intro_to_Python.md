# An Informal Introduction to Python

## Input and Output in Python

Input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (`>>>` and `â€¦`):

- Type everything after the prompt when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter.
- A secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.

You can toggle the display of prompts and output by clicking on `>>>` in the upper-right corner of an example box. If you hide the prompts and output for an example, then you can easily copy and paste the input lines into your interpreter.

### Comments in Python

Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, `#`, and extend to the end of the physical line.

- A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal.
- A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character.
- Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.

**Example:**

```python
# This is the first comment
spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
          # ... and now a third!
text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
```

## 3.1. Using Python as a Calculator
Using Python as a calculator is quick and efficient. The Python prompt (>>>) allows for simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For instance, typing 5 + 3 returns 8. Additionally, Python supports more advanced operations, such as exponentiation (2 ** 3) and modulus (10 % 3).

The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` can be used to perform arithmetic; parentheses `()` can be used for grouping. For example:

```python
>>> 2 + 2
4

>>> 50 - 5*6
20

>>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
5.0

>>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
1.6
```

The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float.

```python
>>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
5.666666666666667

>>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
5

>>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
2

>>> 5 * 3 + 2  # floored quotient * divisor + remainder
17
```

With Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate powers

```python
>>> 5 ** 2  # 5 squared
25

>>> 2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7
128
```


The equal sign (=) is used to give a value to a variable. After that, no result is shown until the next interactive prompt:

```python
>>> width = 20
>>> height = 5 * 9
>>> width * height
900
```

Using an undefined variable will result in an error.

```python
n  # try to access an undefined variable
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'n' is not defined
```


Floating-point numbers are fully supported, and operators with mixed-type operands automatically convert integer operands to floating point.

```python
4 * 3.75 - 1
14.0
```

In interactive mode, the last printed expression gets assigned to the variable _. This implies that when Python is utilized as a desk calculator, continuing calculations becomes somewhat easier.

```python
>>> tax = 12.5 / 100
>>> price = 100.50
>>> price * tax
12.5625
>>> price + _
113.0625
>>> round(_, 2)
113.06
```
