# If Statements

In Python, an if statement allows you to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is met. This is fundamental for controlling the flow of your program, enabling decision-making processes within your code.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of an 'if statement' is"

```
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is true
```

Simple example of 'if' statement
```
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
```

'If' Statement example:
```
>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
>>> if x < 0:
        x = 0
        print('Negative changed to zero')
    elif x == 0:
        print('Zero')
    elif x == 1:
        print('Single')
    else:
        print('More')
```
