# If Statements

In Python, an if statement allows you to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is met. This is fundamental for controlling the flow of your program, enabling decision-making processes within your code.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of an 'if statement' is"

```
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is true
```

Simple example of 'if' statement
```
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
```

You can extend the if statement with else and elif (else if) to handle multiple conditions:
```
>>> age = 17

>>> if age >= 18:
        print("You are an adult.")
>>> elif age >= 13:
        print("You are a teenager.")
>>> else:
        print("You are a child.")
```

<b>Indentation</b>

Python uses indentation to define the scope of the if statement. All lines of code within the if block must be indented by the same amount.
